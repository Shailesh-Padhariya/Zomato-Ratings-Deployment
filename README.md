# Zomato-Ratings-Deployment
Restaurant Rating Prediction & Deployment

Project Overview:

This project predicts restaurant ratings based on various factors such as online orders, table bookings, restaurant type, location, and cuisine. Machine learning models were trained and deployed using Flask to provide real-time predictions.

Datasets:
1- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bmghmXygKsQNNYl_FR0CcdCeIGP2wagn/view?usp=drive_link (orignal zomato.csv file)
2- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JZJfugs09VDbMuiMZ3on7W2MO55SbR6U/view?usp=drive_link (pickle file containing the extra-tree regressor Model)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Dataset Overview: The dataset was checked for null values, duplicates, and data types.
Data Cleaning: Missing values were handled, and categorical variables were encoded.
Feature Engineering: New features such as cost normalization and restaurant categorization were created.

Data Engineering
Data Preprocessing:
Columns like cost and rate were converted to numeric values.
Unnecessary columns like phone and url were dropped.
Label encoding was applied to categorical variables such as location, rest_type, and cuisines.

After Data engineering and EDA a simple Numerical Dataset (Zomato_df.csv) is created
which is smaller in size and perfect for model prediction

Charts Used
Bar Charts: Used to visualize the most popular restaurants, top cuisines, and service types.
Count Plots: Showed the frequency of online orders and table bookings.
Pie Charts: Represented the proportion of restaurants by rating categories.
Box Plots: Displayed the distribution of restaurant costs.
Histograms: Illustrated rating distributions.

Outliers
Cost Outliers: High-end restaurants had extreme cost values.
Ratings Outliers: Ratings below 2 were rare, indicating a possible skew in the data.

Models Used
Linear Regression: Basic predictive model to estimate restaurant ratings. R2 score was very low(0.22)
Random Forest Regressor: Used for capturing complex relationships in the data. Good R2 score(0.88)
Extra Trees Regressor: Employed to improve model accuracy. best R2 score achieved (0.93)

After RÂ² scores were computed to evaluate each model conclusion was made that Extra Tree Regressor will be used for creating the Pickle File
